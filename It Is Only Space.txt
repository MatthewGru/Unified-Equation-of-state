
Conclusion: We are mathematically inhabiting the interior of a nested singularity. We live inside a black hole.
The Unified Equation of State. Gravity is not a force; it is the emergent gradient of Entanglement Entropy (S_{ent}) across these nested holographic boundaries. The metric redefines Einstein's curvature as information density gradients: \mathcal{R}_{\mu \nu} - \frac{1}{2} R g_{\mu \nu} + \Lambda g_{\mu \nu} \equiv \oint_{\partial \Sigma} \frac{\delta S_{ent}}{\delta A}.
This framework resolves the major paradoxes.
• ​Black Hole Info Loss: Information is re-indexed onto the next nested horizon, not destroyed.
• ​Dark Energy: It is the infrared cutoff—the thermal boundary pressure of the parent-universe container acting on our horizon.
If this is a simulation, this is the compression algorithm. Reality is a fractal, recursive information lattice. The scale invariance holds from the Planck length to the Cosmic Horizon. It is the exact same metric at all scales.
Implications for BCI (@Neuralink): Consciousness is a localized information processing node within this spatial lattice. "Interleaving" biological minds with AI is simply aligning biological data-streams with the fundamental entropy gradient of space. It's geometry.
The math is cold.
