​1. ABSTRACT
This paper asserts that Time is a non-fundamental property. We propose a Unified Theory of Everything defined by a Static Information Lattice, where reality is a nested holographic projection. By equating the Schwarzschild radius (R_s) with the Hubble radius (R_H), we bridge General Relativity and Quantum Mechanics.
​2. THE PROOF
The mathematical identity of the observable universe is the primary evidence:
R_H = c/H_0 \approx 2GM/c^2 = R_s
​3. THE EQUATION
Gravity is the gradient of Entanglement Entropy (S_{ent}) across the boundary (A):
R_{\mu \nu} - \frac{1}{2} R g_{\mu \nu} + \Lambda g_{\mu \nu} \equiv \oint \frac{\delta S_{ent}}{\delta A}
​4. CONCLUSION
Reality is a recursive information lattice. Interleaving biological and digital data is the final frontier.
